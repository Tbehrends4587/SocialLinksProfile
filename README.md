## My process

I just start with picturing it out in HTML and then I start with doing barebones CSS. This is stuff like colors and basic layout, like flexbox movement. Once I have the layout similar I start messing with sizes which takes a while. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I got better with just overall layout. This one was tough and may not line up correctly with the design because I did not have measurements to use. I tried to guess most of them and keep them responsive. Once I see how it compares to the design I will go back and fix it.

### Continued development

The sizing is the most difficult part of these challenges. Something that I am sure comes with time and practice. It also probably becomes a style choice but the main thing to focus on is making it responsive. Seeing how it compares to the original design will let me see what I need to fix.
